# TODO 

- general
    - [FIXED] lint result: Parsing error: 'import' and 'export' may appear only with 'sourceType: module'?
    	- for now just added `sourceType: module` to .eslintrc. what is the right way to solve this?
    - babel warnings on docker build?
    - add /v1 to api path?
    - should we use something like swagger?
    - update readme builder example suitable for backend
- routing
    - continue using joi-router or switch to koa-router?
- error handling
    - add known errors to boom
    - fix handled vs unhandled
    - right now error handling is within routes - for api boilerplate should it move outside?
    - add logging/notifications?
- security
    - auth0 integration
    - snyk
	- koa-helmet?
	- owasp checklist
- logging
    - override console.log?
    - winston/morgan/bunyan
    - koa-logger
    - integration to GAE or equivalent
